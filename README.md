  Hello, I am Dakota Walker. I am a student who is currently attending West Virginia State University for a 
bachelor's in Computer Science. This github page is mostly currently getting used a way to store current projects. 
I would also like to go ahead and apologize for the unfinished state of this repository as currently I do not have
much time to work on my projects due to a full schedule from working a part-time job while attending school full-time.
Either way thank you for visiting my github page.
